# Assignment 3
##Instructions for use
- Download the files given, the main ones are: "main.cpp", "Queue.cpp" , "Queue.h" , "Search.cpp" , "Search.h"
- These files contain the headers and definitions as well as the main file that has our examples and actually runs the code.
- If you want to have different results you can always change the numbers to push within the code, but the examples I gave pretty much use all the functions we were told to use.
- Once the code is compiled you will see the results of the examples given:
![A3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d71d936-d8ee-4e02-a030-706dcdeaf22a)
-  Here you see the functions: push(), front(), size(), empty(), move_to_rear(), and pop() being used for the first part as a queue data structure as a linked list.
-  Then we have a queue of values which will be sorted out using a modified version of insertion sort taken from lecture 10 slide 138.
-  At the end, we have a vector list where we test recursive linear search for the last occurrence of an integer.
-  *All numbers can be modified by updating what you push or pop within the code in the main.cpp*
